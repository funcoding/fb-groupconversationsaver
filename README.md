Facebook Group Conversation Saver
========
Facebook group conversation saver is my first try out using fb php sdk. The foundation for this application was given by Mr Dorai Thodla.
<br>
When a user browse through the various posts displayed in facebook group in which the user is a part of, need may arise to keep record of certain posts for future purpose. Users can save those posts by just pressing the "save post" button using this application and the post is instantaneously saved to a word document and automatically e-mailed to user's mail id. New saved posts are automatically updated along with the older posts.
